# Encryption

This project contains how to implement major encryption algorithems in Android/Java to improve the security of the Application.
The encryptions are generally used to transfer secured information between client(Android Application) and server like 
LOGIN DETAILS, PAYMENT TRANSCATIONS so that others can't crack the data.

it also helpd in decreasing the readibility at database side. 

some of the algorithams include
1) SHA1
2) MD5
3) BASE64
4) RSA Algorithem
